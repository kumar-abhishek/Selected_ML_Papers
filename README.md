# Selected Machine Learning Papers

This is a collection of selected machine learning papers I read as a data scientist. The collections mainly includes papers of influential machine learning approaches which may be beyond the scope of machine learning courses or may not appear in machine learning textbook. 

Please feel free to comment and provide suggestions. 

The list is for study purpose only. If any author does not want the paper be listed, please contact xiangshen@gwu.edu.
