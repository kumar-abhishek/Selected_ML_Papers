# Selected Machine Learning Papers

This is a collection of selected machine learning papers I read as a data scientist and it could be used when prepared for interviews. The collections mainly includes papers of influential machine learning approaches which may be beyond the scope of machine learning course. The collections does not focus on the deep learning and its application but it may includes quite a few techinques and applications.

Please feel free to comment and provide suggestions.
